# Behavioral Finance Habit Tracker for Investors

A Python-based command-line application in development, designed to help investors understand and manage the psychological aspects of their trading decisions.

## About The Project

This project aims to provide investors with a tool to log and reflect on their emotional state, market perceptions, and the reasoning behind their investment actions. By fostering self-awareness, the "Behavioral Finance Habit Tracker" is intended to help users identify potential cognitive biases that can impact trading performance. The overall goal is to encourage more disciplined, plan-driven investment strategies.

## Current Progress (as of May 25, 2025)

* **Database Foundation:** Successfully established an SQLite database (`tracker.db`) with a defined schema for `daily_entries`. This was achieved using a Python script (`database_setup.py`) to handle table creation.
* **Core Application Development Started:** Began development of the main application logic in `main.py`.
* **Initial User Input Feature:** Implemented functionality for users to input the date and the "overall market mood" for a daily entry. This includes input validation for the market mood, allowing specific values ("Bullish", "Bearish", "Neutral") and providing an "exit" option for the user.

## Motivation & Learning Goals

This project stems from a keen interest in:
* Exploring the powerful intersection of **behavioral finance** principles and **practical software development**.
* Deepening my skills in **Python** and **SQLite database management** through the creation of a tangible, useful command-line application.
* Investigating how guided **self-reflection**, facilitated by technology, can enhance **investment discipline** and lead to more rational financial decisions.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3
* **Database:** SQLite 3
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Development Environment:** GitHub Codespaces (VS Code interface)
